Upgrade your `blaster-2022` firmware now with Embeetle IDE. On this page you'll find all the required steps.


&nbsp;<br>
# Embeetle IDE
Embeetle is an IDE of Belgian make. You can program the LANA module with it on the `blaster-2024` (flamingo), but you can also program the Atmel chip on the older `blaster-2022`.

&nbsp;<br>
## STEP 1: Download Embeetle IDE
First download Embeetle:
 - [https://embeetle.com/downloads](https://embeetle.com/#embeetle-ide/download)

You can download it for either **Windows** or **Linux**. We don't have MAC support yet.

&nbsp;<br>
## STEP 2: Launch the `arduino-uno-blaster-2022` project
Launch Embeetle and click 'CREATE PROJECT'. Then select `Arduino` for the vendor and look for the project `arduino-uno-blaster-2022`:

&nbsp;<br>
Now click `CREATE` at the bottom. Embeetle IDE will download the sample project and also all the required tools automatically. Then the project opens:

What you see in this screenshot is basically an Arduino UNO project that has been converted into a full-fledged makefile-based C/C++ project. Unlike Arduino, Embeetle IDE gives you access to all the driver files, linker scripts, assembly startup files and more! Nothing is hidden.

&nbsp;<br>
## STEP 3: Plug in the board
Plug in your `blaster-2022` device.

&nbsp;<br>
## STEP 4: Flash the firmware
Now click the `flash` button at the top in Embeetle IDE. Embeetle flashes the firmware to the Atmel chip.

If the flash doesn't work, please check out the solutions on this page:
