When you first power on your Fri3d badge, you can choose to update the firmware "over the air" (OTA)
use the "X" and "Y" buttons to move between buttons on the screen

use the "X" or "Y" button to confirm that you want to go online. This only works on the Fri3d Camp network

There are different partitions. The badge will check each and update if necessary. This may take a while.
